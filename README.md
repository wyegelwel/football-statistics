# Football data scraper

I have had an incredibly difficult time getting statistics for football. This is my attempt to make the data a bit more accessible. I make no guarentees to the validity of the data, as it is pulled directly from [Fox Sports](http://msn.foxsports.com/). The code that did the scraping can be found in src/.


## The data

Check in the data directory of this project for csv of the past few years. 

If you want different data or organized different, you'll have to modify the code. I recommend looking at (download-stats ...) and going from there.
